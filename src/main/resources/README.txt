by zsawyer, ${date}



About:

This is a Minecraft mod based on "Minecraft Forge". It's purpose is to be able to use
Minecraft in conjunction with Mumble's positional audio feature.
(http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)
This means: Directional and positionally attenuated VOIP in relation to
the game world.
It uses the Mumble Link Plugin v1.2.0 and adds native mumble support.
Tested with Mumble 1.2.2 - 1.2.4 and PR_Mumble1.0 .
It also uses JNA (https://github.com/twall/jna).
There is an interface that other mods can use to inject their custom Mumble
context and/or identity.



Prerequisites:

- Minecraft ${mcversion}+
- Minecraft Forge installed (http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/)
- Mumble + advanced option "Link to Game and Transmit Position" activated
     (Configure -> Settings -> Tick "Advanced" -> "Plugins"
        -> Tick "Link to Game and Transmit Position")



Installing the Mod:

1. Close both Mumble and Minecraft.
2. install Minecraft Forge
3. Put the MumbleLink-${version}.jar into your mods folder (DO NOT EXTRACT THE JAR!)
      examples:
        Windows: %Appdata%\\.minecraft\\mods\\MumbleLink-${version}.jar
        Linux: ~/.minecraft/mods/MumbleLink-${version}.jar
4. setup Mumble:
    1. On Mumble's main screen select Configure -> Settings
    2. In Mumble Configuration dialog enable "Advanced" (bottom left)
    3. In Plugins: (see http://i.imgur.com/8K59Rlw.png)
        1. Options section: enable "Link to Game and Transmit Position",
                            if this was disabled, restart after setting this option
        2. in Plugins section: find and enable "Link v1.2.0"
    4. In Audio Output: (see http://i.imgur.com/c5uiVxg.png)
        1. in Positional Audio section: enable Positional AudioÂ´
    5. optional advanced Mumble settings can be found below


Upgrading from earlier Versions:

1. Close both Mumble and Minecraft.
2. install latest Minecraft Forge
3. replace the old MumbleLink-jar with the new one!





Advanced Mumble Configuration

Instead of hearing people from indefinitely far away you can set up mumble to
only hear them when they are close. In return you (and they!) will need to bind
an extra key to communicate with those far away (imagine it being a
"walkie-talkie" button).
To set this up you will need to do some special settings which differ from the
defaults, in return it might enhance your audio experience.

    1. In Audio Output: (see http://i.imgur.com/c6eRKYQ.png)
        1. Positional Audio section: Maximum Distance: 70m
            (this value will determine when others are too far away to be heard)
        2. Positional Audio section: Minimum Volume: 0%
            (this value makes you not hear people beyond Maximum Distance)
        3. Audio Output section: disable "Attenuate applications by... " "while other users talk" and "while you talk"
            (mumble would dampen ArmA's audio if enabled)

    2. In Shortcuts (see http://i.imgur.com/MxSu237.png)
        1. bind a key ("Shortcut") to "Shout/Wisper" "Shout to Channel" select "Current" Channel and make sure to check "Ignore positional audio"
            (this will enable you to speak to everyone no matter how far away they are or what their settings are)





Notes:

- suggested Mumble settings (differing from defaults):
-- advanced option "Link to Game and Transmit Position" activated
    (restart after setting this option)
-- Maximum Distance: 70m
-- Minimum Volume: 0%
-- untick "Attenuate applications by..." "while other users talk" and "while you talk"

- link delay: 10 seconds - normal link delay appears to be about 10 seconds after
    joining a minecraft server. This may vary depending on the PC. The confirmation
    that the plugin linked can however show before the effect kicks in.

- starting order: does not matter,
    Minecraft or Mumble - either can be started first



Troubleshooting:

- Please check the logs in your .minecraft-folder for an error message.
      for Forge: fml-client-latest.log
-- messages from this mod will be indicated by "[MumbleLink]" infront
    of the message

- Errors will occur as "Minecraft has crashed!"  or a black window
-- This either indicates incompatibility to your operating system
-- or you are using an outdated version of the mod
-- check the error report or log files (s.a.) for details



FAQ:

- How do I know that I am linked/the mod works?
    After connecting to a Minecraft-Server (joining a game) Mumble's log will
    show a message "Minecraft linked." after a few seconds. Additionally
    within Minecraft you will see a chat message "Mumble linked." after you have
    joined any world.

- Mumble does not Link:
    - check the logs and check if MumbleLink (Forge)
        - you might not have Forge installed
        - note that Risugami's ModLoader is not supported anymore

- Minecraft crashes with:
    "Minecraft has crashed!
    ...
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: g
        at UpdateData.set(UpdateData.java:XXX)
    ..."
  OR
    "Minecraft has crashed!
    ...
    -- Head --
    Stacktrace:
        at UpdateData.set(UpdateData.java:XXX)
    ..."
        - You are using an incompatible mod version.
        - Get the appropriated one from https://sourceforge.net/projects/modmumblelink/files/
        - there might not be one yet if you just updated Minecraft


    "Minecraft has crashed!
    ...
    Minecraft has stopped running because it encountered a problem; Error in mod
    MumbleLink: Couldn't load library.
    ...
    java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: ..."
        - None of the found libraries can be loaded on your system. Your operating
            system is not supported by this mod. Sorry.
            Please try to compile the required libraries yourself or submit a
            request. (If you successfully compiled them yourself please share :D)


- the log sais:
    "SEVERE: [MumbleLink][SEVERE] Required library could not be loaded,
            available libraries are incompatible!"
        - None of the found libraries can be loaded on your system. Your operating
            system is not supported by this mod. Sorry.
            Please try to compile the required libraries yourself or submit a
            request. (If you successfully compiled them yourself please share :D)


- Mumble sais "Minecraft linked." but I still don't hear people positionally.
    Multiple possibilities:
        1. Mumble is not setup correctly:
            Make sure "Link to Game and Transmit Position" is checked
                (Configure -> Settings -> Tick "Advanced" -> "Plugins"
                    -> Tick "Link to Game and Transmit Position")

        2. The others are not using this mod. Get them to install it! ;)

- Minecraft has no sound/it is really low now
    this is probably due to Mumble itself, it will lower other applications'
    volumes by default
    In Mumble advanced settings, within "Audio Output" untick both:
        "Attenuate applications by..." "while other users talk"
        and "while you talk"



Developing Addons for this Mod:

- Please also refer to changelog of v4.0.2 and the source code comments.

- The interface "MumbleLinkAPI" allows your addon to inject their custom Mumble
    context and/or identity. Use this interface to register your callback
    function handlers. You will have to implement the callback interfaces. It is
    suggested that your addon implements the "Activatable" interface to allow
    other (child) addons to disable your handlers and thus overriding/replacing
    them. This is neccessary since the context and identity fields have a very
    limited length.
    The ExtendedPASupport mod should serve as a sample implementation.
    Please note the javadoc of these files.

    For more information about context and identity consult mumble's doc:
        http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Link#Context



Mod-Packs:

- Generally you are free to distribute it with your private (or public, or
    commercial) mod-packs as specified by LGPLv3.
    That being said, it virtually means no restrictions apply except that
    you should inform users that your mod-pack contains this mod and that
    it is licensed under LGPLv3.
- Feel free to drop a note on the forum that your pack contains this mod.
    It might give you some more users and I simply am curious to see
    where it is used (totally optional!).



Tested Platforms:

- Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit with Forge
    - Forge ${forgeversion} (MC ${mcversion})



Known Issues:

- Does not work with MicDoodleCore. Libraries will not be loading properly. 
    A workaround is described in the forum thread. 
- Does not work with PRMumble(0.5Beta) even after copying the link.dll (1.2.0)
    into PRMumble's plugin folder - it will say "linked" but the audio
    will not be positional (Deprecated since PR_Mumble1.0 is supported now :))
