     * This method is expected to return a string for use as the Mumble
     * positional audio (PA) identity. The result is required to adhere to the
     * maxLength requirement which is dictated by the Link Plugin's internal
     * data structure and specifies the number of characters that can be sent.
     * </p><p>
     * The possibly previously manipulated identity is handed over and expected
     * to be respected by each implementation. Respecting herein means that the
     * previous identity should be - if possible - appended to, or at least be
     * reparsed (e.g. if length is likely to be over stepped).
     * </p><p>
     * For compatibility with other addons the suggested format is JSON.

     * <p>
     * Excerpt from Mumble Wiki (http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Link 2013-07-08):
     * </p><p>
     * Identity should contain a string which uniquely identifies the player in
     * the given context. This is usually satisfied by the in-game player name
     * or the players ID (player-/connection-ID on the server or a global ID).
     * </p><p>
     * Additionally the identity can contain any additional information about
     * the player that might be interesting for the mumble server.
     * </p><p>
     * For example by including team information in the identity a script on the
     * mumble server can move players into team channels automatically.
     * Additional information like squad number, squad leader status and so on
     * can be used to trigger even more behavior like automatically maintaining
     * a leadership structure inside mumble which is kept in-sync with in-game
     * state. E.g. someone is elected squad leader and now can whisper to all
     * other squad leaders and the team leader. For an example of such a
     * server-side script see the Battlefield 2 MuMo plugin.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param identity  the identity with all previous manipulations applied expect it
     *                  to be a string representation of a JSON-Object which you can
     *                  append key-value pairs to
     * @param game      the Minecraft instance for convenience
     * @param maxLength the maximum number of characters the returned string may have,
     *                  else it will not fit into the Link-Plugin's data structure
     * @return (preferably) a string representation of a JSON-Object (keep in
     * mind that not using JSON will probably make your addon
     * incompatible with other manipulator instances)
